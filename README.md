# iNAS : Intermittent-aware Neural Architecture Search

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Overview

This repository contains iNAS, a neural architecture search (NAS) framework which finds deep neural networks (DNNs) that can be feasibly deployed and executed on *intermittently-powered* systems. iNAS co-explores the neural architecture, execution design and preservation design spaces to find highly accurate DNNs that can *safely* and *efficiently* execute under intermittent power.


We develop iNAS on top of an existing [hardware-aware NAS](https://github.com/PITT-JZ-COOP/FPGA-implementation-Aware-Neural-Architecture-Search) (as published in [DAC 2019](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3316781.3317757)), where we adapt the NAS controller and DNN Trainer, as well as introduce the following two key components to introduce *intermittent execution behavior* into NAS: 

* Intermittent-aware Execution Design Explorer (iNAS-Exp)
* Intermittent-aware Abstract Performance Model (iNAS-PMod)

NAS iteratively generates child networks. For each child network, iNAS-Exp explores the execution design and preservation design spaces, and uses the energy budget, hardware specification and latency requirement as search constraints. iNAS-PMod derives the end-to-end inference latency of a the child network and corresponding intermittent execution design, by considering all additional key costs related to progress preservation and progress recovery. 


The derived iNAS solutions (i.e., network models with associated intermittent execution designs) are deployed on the Texas Instruments MSP430FR5994 LaunchPad and executed using an intermittent inference library that is also included in this repository. 

A demo video comparing solutions found by iNAS and a hardware-aware NAS can be found [here](https://youtu.be/D1D9nk67QTI)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

###### iNAS
iNAS is implemented using Python 3.7, so we recommend installing the [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) distribution of Python and related packages. The required dependencies to run iNAS can be found in the included `iNAS/requirements_pip.txt` file. 

###### Intermittent Inference Library
Here is the basic software and hardware needed to build/run the intermittent inference runtime library. 
* [Code composer studio](http://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO "link") (recommended versions: > 7.0)
* [MSP Driver Library](http://www.ti.com/tool/MSPDRIVERLIB "link")
* [MSP DSP Library](http://www.ti.com/tool/MSP-DSPLIB "link")
* [MSP-EXP430FR5994 LaunchPad](http://www.ti.com/tool/MSP-EXP430FR5994 "link")
