"""Simple speech recognition to spot a limited number of keywords.

This is a self-contained example script that will train a very basic audio
recognition model in TensorFlow. It downloads the necessary training data and
runs with reasonable defaults to train within a few hours even only using a CPU.
For more information, please see
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/audio_recognition.

It is intended as an introduction to using neural networks for audio
recognition, and is not a full speech recognition system. For more advanced
speech systems, I recommend looking into Kaldi. This network uses a keyword
detection style to spot discrete words from a small vocabulary, consisting of
"yes", "no", "up", "down", "left", "right", "on", "off", "stop", and "go".

To run the training process, use:

bazel run tensorflow/examples/speech_commands:train

This will write out checkpoints to /tmp/speech_commands_train/, and will
download over 1GB of open source training data, so you'll need enough free space
and a good internet connection. The default data is a collection of thousands of
one-second .wav files, each containing one spoken word. This data set is
collected from https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/open_speech_recording, please
consider contributing to help improve this and other models!

As training progresses, it will print out its accuracy metrics, which should
rise above 90% by the end. Once it's complete, you can run the freeze script to
get a binary GraphDef that you can easily deploy on mobile applications.

If you want to train on your own data, you'll need to create .wavs with your
recordings, all at a consistent length, and then arrange them into subfolders
organized by label. For example, here's a possible file structure:

my_wavs >
  up >
    audio_0.wav
    audio_1.wav
  down >
    audio_2.wav
    audio_3.wav
  other>
    audio_4.wav
    audio_5.wav

You'll also need to tell the script what labels to look for, using the
`--wanted_words` argument. In this case, 'up,down' might be what you want, and
the audio in the 'other' folder would be used to train an 'unknown' category.

To pull this all together, you'd run:

bazel run tensorflow/examples/speech_commands:train -- \
--data_dir=my_wavs --wanted_words=up,down
